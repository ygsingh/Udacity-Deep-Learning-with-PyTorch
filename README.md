# Udacity-Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch
This repo contains reference examples on how to build deep learnig models using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). PyTorch is an open-source Python framework form the [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) team used for develpoing deep neural networks.
## Implementing Gradient Descent
Implementing functions that build the gradient decsent algorithm, namely:
- `sigmoid`: The sigmoid activation function.
- `output_formula`: The formula for the prediction.
- `error_formula`: The formula for the error at a point.
- `update_weight`: The function that updates the parameters with one gradient descent step.
- `train`: Iterate the gradient descent algorithm through all the data, for a number of epochs.

## Analyzing Student Data
Predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on *GRE Scores*, *GPA Scores*, and *Class Rank*. Implementing some of the steps in the training of the neural network, namely:
- One-hot encoding the data
- Scaling the data
- Writing the backpropagation step
- Gradient decent algorithm for training the neural network
